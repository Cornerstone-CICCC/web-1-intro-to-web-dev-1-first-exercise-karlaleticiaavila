<section> <article> <h2> About me</h2> 
<p>My name is Karla Ávila — a dreamer, a mother, and a model in the making. I left my home country with a heart full of courage, chasing the promise of a better life for my daughter and myself. 
    Every challenge I’ve faced in a new land has shaped me, not only as a woman but as an artist — someone who turns struggle into strength and uncertainty into faith. </p>

<p> Modeling is my language of expression. Through every photo, I tell a story of perseverance, of learning to love myself, and of believing that purpose and beauty can coexist. 
    My journey reminds me and I hope reminds others that it’s never too late to rewrite your story and walk toward the light you were born to shine in.</p></article></section>
